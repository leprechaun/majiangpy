MajiangPy
=========
I learned to play Majiang over a weekend with a friend in Guangdong.
I looked for OSS implementations, but haven't found anything that was
outstanding and would let me write AI for it.

It's written in Python 3 and has decent coverage for the present functionality.

For now, there are no external dependencies, except unittest.
